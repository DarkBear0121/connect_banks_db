Returns bank name and brand color by bankcard prefix (BIN).

It is useful on billing pages to use bankâ€™s brand color when user starts to type card number.

![banks-db usage example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7067080/12102184/68851c68-b339-11e5-91c1-6a71797ada87.png)

It is a community driven database, so it can potentially contain mistakes. It's not a problem for UX enhancement,
but you must not use it in your billing logic.

## Contributing

In case your bankcard doesn't work, please check if your bank already in [Banks DB](https://github.com/Ramoona/banks-db/tree/master/banks):

- If your bank is already included, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/Ramoona/banks-db/issues) with your prefix (NOT full number of your card, just first 5 or 6 symbols) or send a pull request.
- Otherwise you can add a new bank (see [contributing guide](https://github.com/Ramoona/banks-db/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)).
